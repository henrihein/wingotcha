# wingotcha


A Desktop Lock utility with Webcam Capture.

Basic function is: monitor keyboard and mouse input.
After a brief pause (1-2 minutes), soft-lock the desktop.
Unlock happens with a series of mouse clicks, combined with
ALT and CTRL key presses.  If more than a little input is
detected while locked, or after repeated failed attempts at
unlocking, start the webcam to capture the person who is
operating the keyboard, who presumably is unauthorized.

Ostensibly a security utility, this program is aimed at
casual use, such as if you suspect your coworkers are 
messing with your system, and you want to find out who it
is.  It is not robust enough to be a substitute for any
real protection of your system.  It is compatible with,
and makes use of, the Windows desktop hard locking 
feature.  (Using 'soft' and 'hard' locking here to 
distinguish between the Wingotcha lock from the Windows
desktop lock).
